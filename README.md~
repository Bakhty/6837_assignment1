COMMENTS:
This assignment took me probably around 10 to 12 hours total.
The hardest part for me is getting started. Despite attending lecture, I still find myself confused as to how to approach the problems, so I spent a lot of time in the beginning trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do.
I did learn a lot from doing this assignment, and it definitely helped me understand Bezier/B-spline curves better. Pretty overwhelming still though.
